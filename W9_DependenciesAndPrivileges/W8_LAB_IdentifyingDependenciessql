-- Chapter 8 Exercise

--Assignment 8-5: Identifying Dependencies 
--At this point, you have created a variety of database objects in your schema. Use an Oracle tool 
--to identify all the direct and indirect dependencies on the BB_BASKET table, and produce 
--dependency lists in two different formats. Identify each object as a direct or an indirect 
--dependency, and describe the path of dependency for each indirectly dependent object. 

-- use dept tree procedure to populate the deptree and ideptree views
                  -- object being analyzed, schema name, object name
EXECUTE deptree_fill('TABLE', 'COMP214_F24_YU_72', 'BB_BASKET'); -- identifies ALL dependent objects related to this table 

-- DEPTREE view lists dependencies with e numeric level scheme
SELECT nested_level, name, type, seq#
    FROM deptree
    ORDER BY seq#; -- added so the list is ordered by sequence/hierarchy
    
-- nested level: 
    -- 1 = DIRECT dependency (trigger otr foreign key)
    -- 2 = INDIRECT dependency
    
--IDEPTREE lists same dependencies with with 1 or 2 indents to represent direct/indirect dependencies 
SELECT *
    FROM ideptree;
